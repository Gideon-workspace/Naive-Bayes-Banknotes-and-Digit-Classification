# Naive-Bayes-Banknotes-and-Digit-Classification



![NAIVE BAYES](NB.png)

A collection of **Naive Bayes classifiers implemented from scratch**, demonstrating binary and multiclass classification on real-world datasets:  
- **Banknote Legitimacy Classification** – Detect genuine vs counterfeit banknotes  
- **Digit Classification** – Recognize handwritten digits  

Both projects include preprocessing, probability computation, and prediction logic without using pre-built ML libraries, emphasizing the **mathematical foundations of Naive Bayes**.

A collection of **Naive Bayes classifiers implemented from scratch**, demonstrating binary and multiclass classification on real-world datasets. The projects include **Banknote Legitimacy Classification** and **Handwritten Digit Classification**, highlighting the mathematical foundations of Naive Bayes.

- **Banknote Legitimacy Classification** – Detect whether banknotes are genuine or counterfeit based on statistical features.  
- **Digit Classification** – Recognize handwritten digits from pixel data.  

Both projects include **preprocessing, probability computation, and prediction logic**, all built without pre-built ML libraries, emphasizing how Naive Bayes works from the ground up.
